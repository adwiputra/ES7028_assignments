## 1. Squirrel Data

In a study of squirrels, the weight of 50 female and 50 male squirrels was measured. The observations are in the columns FEMALE and MALE (Squirrels dataset).

1A. Plot the data using histogram(s) and boxplot(s).
```{r histoBox_squirrel, echo=FALSE}
# 0. LOAD RELEVANT LIBRARIES======
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
# Read the data
squirrelData <- "Assignment_1data.xls" %>% read_excel() # %>% mutate(id = 1:nrow(squirrelData))
# Reshape the data
squirrelData <- squirrelData %>% pivot_longer(cols = 1:2, names_to = "Sex", values_to = "weight") %>% mutate(Sex = as.factor(Sex))
ggplot(squirrelData, aes(x = weight, fill = Sex)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, alpha = .5, position = "identity")
# box plot
ggplot(squirrelData) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Sex, y = weight), notch = TRUE)
```
1B. Perform a two-sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney test.

1C. What features of the plots suggest that the use of a parametric test may be unwise?

1D. From the results of the (parametric) t-test, report the t, dfs, and p-values, and interpret them.

1E. From the results of the (non-parametric) Mann-Whitney test, report the W, and p-values, and interpret them.

1F. What type of error do you get if you use a t-test?

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
